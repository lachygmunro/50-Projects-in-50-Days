# 50-Projects-in-50-Days

This is a course via Packt that walks through 50 different projects that utilise HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm working through these projects to increase my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript while also seeing how these languages can interact to create fun and interesting websites. This will also be a great resource to look back on in the future when creating my own projects.
